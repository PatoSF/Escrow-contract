# What is an Escrow contract?
An escrow agreement is a contract that specifies the terms and conditions of the parties involved, as well as their respective responsibilities. Escrow agreements often require an independent third party, known as an escrow agent, who holds a valuable asset until the contract's specified conditions are satisfied. They should, however, fully define the terms for all parties involved.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

# npm install 
Please run 'npm install' to install all the packages required.
Read the word document to understand the functionality of the contract and unit test.
